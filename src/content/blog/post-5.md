Web accessibility ensures that everyone, including people with disabilities, can use your website. Here are some key practices:

- Use semantic HTML for better screen reader support.
- Add descriptive `alt` text for images.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast.
- Test your site with accessibility tools.

Building accessible websites is not just good practice—it’s a way to create a more inclusive web for everyone.
